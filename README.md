# Obelisk Wallet — Dev Ready

Interface to **VOID**. Rewards in **VoidStones ($VOID)**.

## Run dev server
```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```
Then open the URL printed by Vite (default http://localhost:5173).

## Configure a token for balance previews
Set `VITE_VOID_ADDRESS` to a deployed ERC-20 (e.g., VoidStones) to enable balance reads.
Set `VITE_PUBLIC_RPC` to your RPC (e.g., Sepolia Infura URL).

## Notes
- Built with Vite + React + Tailwind.
- Uses `ethers` v6.
- Future: Ghost/Wraith/Titan toggles with resource caps.
